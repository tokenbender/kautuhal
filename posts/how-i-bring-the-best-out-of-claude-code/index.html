        <h1>how i bring the best out of claude code - part 1</h1>
        <h2>1. setup requirements</h2>
<p>you need a set of requirements, preferably issues in a repo. take the requirement url and download and save it into an <code>issues/</code> folder or have github integration with claude code. then create a file like <code>&lt;issue_no&gt;.md</code> or whatever you prefer.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>note:</strong> your requirements list is very crucial, and you should treat it like a wish list for work to be done.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>the more vague you are in describing what you want, the higher the chance you won&#39;t get what you wanted. ideally, your instructions should be as unambiguous as a program.</p>
<p>you also want to be aware of what is already known by the model.</p>
<h2>2. most important thing: context management</h2>
<p>a common pattern:</p>
<pre><code>[claude code] --&gt; [todo list]
               (fresh context)
</code></pre>
<p>better approach:</p>
<pre><code>well-formalized --&gt; issues/&lt;issue_no&gt;.md (plan)
                --&gt; docs/plan_&lt;issue_no&gt;.md (issue requirement)
</code></pre>
<p>this <code>plan_&lt;issue_no&gt;.md</code> serves as claude&#39;s context. the <code>todo.md</code> is essentially exactly the same as your to-do list.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>the todo list is nice, but as you consume things in longer context in claude code, it becomes hard to keep up. so we store it inside the <code>todo.md</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>3. parallel claude code usage</h2>
<p>if you&#39;re using multiple claude code windows in parallel, assign each one an issue and its corresponding docs, todos, and requirements. this way, everything is tracked automatically.</p>
<p>currently, i don&#39;t use claude code in parallel much because it tends to create new files for everything, prompt to edit existing files directly, and update code based on outdated or flawed understanding.</p>
<p>that&#39;s why i often ask it to detail its plan so i can do smell checks and question intentions like <em>&quot;oh, you were aiming to do xyz. then why modify abc?&quot;</em></p>
<p>additionally, claude might start running commands unknowingly and fill context with needless output tokens.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>i avoid this by running it manually myself, providing a snippet of the error so it can best debug it.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>4. execution strategy</h2>
<p>once you&#39;re going through each item, do it step by step while enforcing quality standards. you decide how frequently to execute and ensure there are no blindspots.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>personally, i avoid diving into thousands of loc i haven&#39;t written or understood.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>5. iteration and updating context</h2>
<p>as i implement and ensure smooth execution, i iterate with errors and debug, then go back and update crucial observations in the planning docs.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>this allows the model to build better understanding of the issue and what is already known.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>6. working compactly</h2>
<p>in an ideal world, you work on one issue end-to-end in one session.</p>
<p>but usually, context fills out faster and faster. you&#39;ll find yourself using &quot;compact&quot; more often.</p>
<p>if you ever run out of context during execution, claude auto-compacts or asks you to go back to a previous node.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>this is useful when i see a model ignoring feedback and going in loops. in such cases, i jump to a clean node where i was satisfied, compact, generate a summary, and start fresh.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>7. integrating claude code into tooling</h2>
<p>now that claude code sdk exists, you can add it to your tools.</p>
<p>i&#39;ve been using it in shell scripts and proto files. my protocols reflect opinionated views of deep research methodologies and how i debug or visit the ecosystem.</p>
<p>for instance, my ecosystem has <code>issues/</code> and <code>todo.md</code> folders. i use a shell script to invoke tasks in specific ways and let claude interact with other claude instances.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>essentially, i&#39;m building a local multi-agent system of my own.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>8. final thoughts</h2>
<p>what are these systems? what protocols are being enforced? how is multi-agent design different? what gives it an edge over standard usage?</p>
<p>these are things i&#39;d like to cover in part 2.</p>
<hr>
<p>until then, be well everyone!</p>
